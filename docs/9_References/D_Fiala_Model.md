# Fiala Model

The Fiala tire model is based on the physical characteristics of the tire. The table below summarizes these characteristics. This model does not include combined longitudinal or lateral force, the effect of inclination angle, the lateral force offset at zero slip (from tire conicity or ply steer), or tire load sensitivity. More information about the Fiala model can be found in "The Multibody Systems Approach to Vehicle Dynamics", 2004, by Mike Blundell and Damian Harty.

|Fiala Model Parameter|Unit Type|
|:---:|:---:|
|R1 (Tire tread width divided by two)|length|
|Cs (Longitudinal tire slip stiffness)|force / ratio|
|Calpha (Lateral tire slip stiffness)|force / angle|
|Cr (Rolling resistance moment coefficient)|length|
|U0 (Tire static friction coefficient)|ratio|
|U1 (Tire sliding friction coefficient)|ratio|
