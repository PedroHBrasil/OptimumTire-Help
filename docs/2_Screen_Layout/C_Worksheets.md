# Worksheets

The worksheet is the area where graphs can be added to the project. Creating graphs will be covered in the [Graphing](../5_Graphing/5_Graphing.md) section. An unlimited number of worksheets can be included in a project. To add a new worksheet, click on the __Worksheet__ menu and select __New Worksheet__. Alternatively, worksheets can be added by right-clicking on the worksheet or the worksheet tabs and selecting __New Worksheet__.

Worksheets can be renamed by right-clicking on the worksheet and choosing __Rename Worksheet__.  A worksheet can be deleted (and all the graphs on that worksheet) by choosing __Delete Worksheet__ from the menu that appears when you right-click on a worksheet. Note that you cannot undo a delete operation.
