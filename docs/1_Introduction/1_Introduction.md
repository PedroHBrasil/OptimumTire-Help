# Introduction

Through OptimumG’s consulting and seminar services, it identified tire data analysis and model fitting as an important, but often neglected area of vehicle dynamics. Therefore, OptimumTire was created from OptimumG’s extensive knowledge and experience in testing, Analysis, and development of vehicle tires and suspension systems. OptimumTire is a convenient and intuitive software package that allows users to perform advanced tire data analysis, visualization, and model fitting.

Pacejka ’96, 2002, and 2006 as well as the MF5.2 and MF6.1 tire models are available in OptimumTire.  Simpler Brush, Fiala and Harty models are also included. The models can be manually inputted, imported, or fit to raw tire data. The model fitting procedure is very fast and efficient partially due to the data processing tools incorporated into the software. All aspects of the tire models can be easily compared to the raw tire data to ensure accuracy.  OptimumTire also allows adjustment of the tire models if necessary and includes scaling factors for the Pacejka models. These features ensure that the tire models created will accurately correlate to data collected from the road or race track. These tire models, as well as the processed data, can be exported from OptimumTire to a variety of file formats.

OptimumTire is also a very powerful data visualization tool. It has the capability to display tire models and raw tire data in a user friendly but extremely powerful graphing utility. It features 2D and 3D graphing of over 30 different tire parameters. The ability to create surface plots and crossed line graphs allows the user to be able to easily create sophisticated graphs, like tire friction ellipses. The graphs can be further enhanced by including the effect of many different parameters including vertical load, inclination angle, and inflation pressure. These graphs can be easily copied or directly printed from the OptimumTire interface to be included in other projects or reports. The data from these graphs can also be exported for further analysis.
