# License

## Moving License
If the license needs to be moved to another computer this can be done through OptimumTire. The two computers will both need to have an internet connection. To move a license to another computer:

* Launch OptimumTire.
* From the project screen select the Help menu and click Deactivate License.
* Click Yes in the Deactivate License message box.
* Click Deactivate in the Web Activation message box.
  
The "Online Deactivation was successful" message box will appear once the license has been deactivated. OptimumTire can know be installed on another computer using the same license key.

## License Viewer

The license viewer shows the status of the current license and allows the user to enter a new time license. Once OptimumTire is installed the license viewer can be accessed through the Windows start menu. It will be in the OptimumTire folder. A new OptimumTire time license can be activated by pressing the Activation Key button in the lower left corner of the license viewer. Then the new license key can be inputted and activated.
