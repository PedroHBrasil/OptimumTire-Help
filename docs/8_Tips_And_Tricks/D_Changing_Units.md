# Changing Units

When a unit is changed in OptimumTire its corresponding value is automatically converted to the new unit. If you wish to change the unit of a quantity without performing a unit conversion, hold down the __shift__ key while selecting the new unit. For example, if you type 10 into an input box with the unit m selected, but you wish to enter 10mm, simply changing the unit to mm will perform a unit conversion, resulting in 10000mm. If you hold down the __shift__ key while selecting the new unit, the desired result of 10mm will result.
