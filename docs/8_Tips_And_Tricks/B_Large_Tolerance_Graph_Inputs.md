# Large Tolerance Graph Inputs

There are cases when you want to make graphs without regard to a certain tire condition. For example, if you want to plot data for several different inflation pressures, without typing in all of the specific pressures into the display. In cases like this, you can simply set the graph input as some arbitrary fixed value and set a very large tolerance. Taking the inflation pressure example, if you had tire data taken at 1.50, 1.75, 2.00 and 2.25 bar, you could set the graph input for inflation pressure to a fixed value of 2.00 bar and set the tolerance to 2.00 bar. All of the inflation pressures will then be displayed.
