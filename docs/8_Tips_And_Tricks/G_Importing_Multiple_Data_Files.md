# Importing Multiple Data Files

If more than one data file needs to be imported and merged, then they can be simply be selected together when choosing files to import. Hold down the __shift__ or __ctrl__ key to select multiple files. Note that all the files selected must be in exactly the same format (columns in the same order and the same units used). This feature can be useful if multiple files are produced in a single test. For example, if cornering data for different inclination angles are contained in different files, it is useful to multi-select when importing so that these files are merged within OptimumTire when they are imported.
