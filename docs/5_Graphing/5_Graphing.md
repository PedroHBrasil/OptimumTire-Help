# Graphing

The OptimumTire plotting tool is a powerful feature that allows users to create nearly any type of tire graph that they please. Two different types of graphs can be created in OptimumTire. One is a standard graph which allows plotting of any quantity against any other quantity in either two- or three-dimensions. The other is a report graph which shows measured quantities versus sample number. It is only capable of plotting raw data.
