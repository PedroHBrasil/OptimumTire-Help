# Exporting Data

By selecting the __Options-Export__ button at the top of the raw data entry form the tire data can be exported to an OptimumTire Raw Data File or a CSV file. After the desired format is selected a dialog box will appear. Clicking on the Yes button will export the cropped and collapsed tire data while clicking on the __No__ button will export the raw tire data.
