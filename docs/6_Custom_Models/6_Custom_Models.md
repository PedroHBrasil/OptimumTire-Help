# Custom Models

Custom models are part of the advanced features available in OptimumTire. This functionality gives users the flexibility to include user developed custom models within the OptimumTire environment. With the custom models feature users can write their own models in house, therefore keeping proprietary models confidential and providing the ability to tailor models to the exact specifications required. Custom models need only to be coded once, they can then be used repeatedly and as efficiently as any of the hard-coded models available within OptimumTire. The custom model package is an advanced feature which requires an additional activation license available by contacting [engineering@optimumg.com](mailto:engineering@optimumg.com)
