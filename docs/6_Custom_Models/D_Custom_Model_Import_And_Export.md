# Custom Model Import And Export

The import and export functions work for the custom model in the same way as the standard tire models in OptimumTire (see [Import And Export Models](../4_Tire_Models/B_Import_And_Export_Models.md)).

However to export models to .tir or Excel format the user must first create a template for each model. The process for creating and modifying export templates is illustrated in [Export Templates](../4_Tire_Models/B_Import_And_Export_Models.md#Export-Templates).
